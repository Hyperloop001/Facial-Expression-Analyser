# Facial Expression Analyser

## Intro:
    Function: provides real-time analysis on facial expression upon each successful face detection through video cameras.
    Progress: the detector was trained and fine-tuned by applying supervised learning on fer2013 datasets via convolutional neural networks backended in TensorFlow.
    Status: work in progress
    
## To run it:
    Get Python3, Dilb, OpenCV, numpy, Keras & Tensorflow, and ur ready to rock'n roll :) (I guess you need a camera to say cheese)
